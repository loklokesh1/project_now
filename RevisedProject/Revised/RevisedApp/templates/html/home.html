<p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;font-size: 18px;">With expanding the role of business globally, AITS is the place which comes to the minds of the recruiters once the placement season starts. As far as, Annamacharya Group of Institutions is considered, we focus not only on the career-oriented growth but also offer versatility. There has been a consistent growth in our placements record. Today, graduating does not mean getting a degree certificate alone but equipping one with in-depth knowledge of the subject. It has also become mandatory that the student instills both technical and soft skills within him in order to reach heights. AITS helps the students to achieve this by conducting various workshops, guest lectures and seminars and also by letting them participate in various other extra-curricular activities. We are passionate towards grooming the students not only as the efficient professionals but also as the responsible citizens. At AITS, it is our incessant endeavour to make all our students industry-ready.</p>

  		Alice's Adventures Under Ground is a "facsimile" (shortened) version, the original manuscript and illustrations Charles Dodgson finished in 1864 for his friend, Alice Liddell, later published as the iconic fantasy novel for all ages, The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland (1865), using the pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. These original illustrations and handwritten texts are a real treasure, and remained in Liddell's possession until 1928, when she sold them at auction to pay her husband's debts. Purchased by an American art dealer and sold again, the manuscript was purchased by British benefactors in 1946 who donated it to the British people, installed at The British Museum in 1948, commemorating the end of World War II. [The photo of Alice Dodgson included in the manuscript (below) was not unveiled to the public until 1977.]
